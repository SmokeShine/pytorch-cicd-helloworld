To create a simple example of a predefined CI/CD configuration for a PyTorch "Hello World" project using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your PyTorch project.
1. Initialize a new GitHub Action workflow file. In this example, we'll call it .github/workflows/main.yml.
```
name: PyTorch Hello World CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Set up Python and PyTorch dependencies
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      # Step 2: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install torch torchvision -f requirements.txt

      # Step 3: Run a simple PyTorch script
      - name: Run Hello World
        run: |
          python -m torch.jit script.pt
```
1. Create a new file named script.py in your project's root directory with the following content:
```
import torch

x = torch.randn(2, 2)
y = x.pow(2)
print(x)
print(y)
```
1. Create a requirements.txt file in your project's root directory to list your Python dependencies, including PyTorch.
```
torch==1.10.0
torchvision==0.11.0
```
1. Commit and push the main.yml, requirements.txt, and script.py files to your GitHub repository.
1. Once you've pushed the changes, your GitHub Actions workflow will be activated. Whenever you make a push or open a pull request, the workflow will automatically build and test your "Hello World" PyTorch script.
